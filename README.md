# Introduction

Pick-Up-Stix allows you to create items as Tokens that players can pick up. It will automatically add the items to the player's inventory.

## Limitations/Features
- Player's must be within one square of the item in order to pick it up (not configurable at the moment)
- Player's must control one and only one token when picking up an item

## Known Issues

- There is a hover issue which can add the yellow hover border over items when there shouldn't be.
- HUD does not update until you close and re-open the HUD
