# Introduction

Pick-Up-Stix allows you to create items as Tokens that players can pick up. It will automatically add the items to the player's inventory.

## Features
- Drop items from the items directory
- Drop items from the compendiums without importing them
- Create containers out of dropped items, lock them, add open and closed images
- Players may pick items up
- Players may drop items from their own inventories onto the map that other players can pick up
- Drop Items directly onto a token to add it to the actor's inventory
- Drag items from an actor's inventory onto another Token or another actor's inventory to transfer the item to that Actor's inventory

## Limitations
- Player's must be within one square of the item in order to pick it up (not configurable at the moment)

## Future Considrations and Plans
- Loot sheet for items.
  - Randomization of items given out
  - Allow players to choose items they want and then click an accept button and when all have accepted, distribute loot
- Loot dead bodies
- Steal from living bodies using DC checks and notifications to GM if it fails
- Allowing addition of items via the 'add' button on the item config application

## Known Issues

### Possible incompatibilies

It has been reported that some modules might be incompatible with Pick-Up-Stix. Mostly those having to do with dragging/dropping functionality as that overlaps with the behavior of mine. I will endeavor to fix these issues though I can make no guarantees as to any timelines. Please let me know what you find. Thank you.
