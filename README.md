# Introduction

Pick-Up-Stix allows you to create items as Tokens that players can pick up. It will automatically add the items to the player's inventory.

I mainly play Dungeons and Dragons 5th and therefore I develop and test with that in mind and with the modules that I use in mind. So I apologize if it might take time to get to things sometimes. This is my first module and of course it's in my free time. Please message me on discord @kamcknig anytime though with any quetions and I will get back when I can.

## Features
- Drop items from the items directory or compendiums onto the canvas, players, or containers
- Create containers out of dropped items, lock them, add open and closed images.
- Create container items in the Items Directory with pre-filled loot
- Players may pick items up
- Players may drop items from their own inventories onto the canvas, other players or loot containers
- Players must be within one square of loot to interact with it
- Choose which controlled token interacts with the loot

## Future Considrations and Plans
- Using roll tables to fill loot container
- Loot dead bodies
- Steal from living bodies using DC checks and notifications to GM if it fails
- Allowing addition of items via the 'add' button on the item config application

## Known Issues

- The feature to create item container 'templates' by using the 'Create Item' button on the Items Directory is very new and hasn't been thoroughly tested.
